Explaination:

I used express framework for the web app.

I didn't use any database for the app because I'm confused by "All data should be stored on the local file system".
(I don't know if we are allowed to use database so I saved all data on local file system in json format.
 I think it would be better designed if I can use a database and I'm very familiar with SQL and noSQL databse. )
